          Imagine a loom. Not for fabric — but for stories. Every idea is a
          thread. Every branch, a path. And every Weaver brings their
          imagination to the loom to create something entirely new, together.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Weaver</strong> is a collaborative short story platform where
        imagination takes the lead. It's designed for creators of all kinds to
        build, share, and evolve stories together — one thread at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        At its core, Weaver is about community-driven storytelling. Weavers
        (that's you!) can write short story prompts, add to others' stories, or
        explore alternate storylines by branching off with your own creative
        twists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're continuing someone’s story, posting a unique idea, or
        exploring a "What if?" branch, Weaver helps you connect with other
        storytellers in a fun, flexible, and inspiring environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe storytelling is for everyone — and the best stories are the
        ones we create together. So whether you're here to write, read, or just
        explore, welcome to the world of Weaver.
