            Hello, Weavers... 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            We‚Äôre Cyrl, Stella, and Corey ‚Äî a team of developers who met
            through a full-stack bootcamp and bonded over a shared love for
            creative coding.

              The React Architect
            </h2>
            Cyrl brought everything to life with front-end magic and her love for design.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Everything you see and interact with is the result of her creative touch, chaos, and
            attention to detail.
            <br></br> 
            <br></br>
            She crafted the whole user interface, ensuring that every button, every
            animation, and every interaction is a delightful experience for you.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Cyrl is the one who made sure that the magic is not just a dream, but a reality.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h2 style={{ fontSize: "2.7rem", color: "#baffff", textShadow: "0 0 6px #0ff" }}>
              The Data Architect
            </h2>
            Stella made sure that the server can handle the magic and that the data flows smoothly.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Without the data, the magic would be lost in the void, and Cyrl would not be able to create this rich world for you. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            With her expertise in backend development, she designed the database
            and server architecture, ensuring that everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The Scribe of the Weave‚ÄïStella is the one who makes sure that the data is always there, ready to be used by Cyrl and Corey.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h2 style={{ fontSize: "2.7rem", color: "#baffff", textShadow: "0 0 6px #0ff" }}>
              The Controller Architect
            </h2>
            Corey made sure that everything worked and the Villainous Bugs are squashed! <br></br> <br></br>
            With hundreds and hundreds of codes to make this whole thing possible, 
            a sneaky bug can break the whole magic. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            With Cyrl and Stella teaming up to create the Multiverses for you, Corey made sure that their chaos is controlled.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            He is the one who makes sure that things are working as they should, and that nothing breaks this illusion for you. <br></br>

            Together, we built <strong>Weaver</strong> as a passion project

            Weaver is more than an app ‚Äî it‚Äôs our love letter to imagination,
